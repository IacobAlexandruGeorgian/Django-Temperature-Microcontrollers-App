# Django - Temperature - App
  - This web application extracts measurements from a MySQL database and displays them, on the first page, in a table, and on the second page, through 2 graphs.
  - The user can view and download meteorological indices according to the time at which they were stored in the database.

 # Microcontrollers - Meteo Stations
  - The project consists in the wireless transmission of encrypted data between a weather station and a base station.
  - The weather station is based on an Arduino model connected to 2 sensors and a wireless device.
  - The base station is made of a Raspberry Pi model connected to the second wireless device.
  - The data is encrypted with an RSA algorithm and transmitted through a Master-Slave protocol between the two stations.
  
  - Weather station (Consola)
